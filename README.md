# piecewise_exponential

Repository for a python function that produces a piecewise exponential function.

The intention of this repository is to make a funciton that takes an array of x values and an array of y
values and returns a piecewise exponential function with the provided x and y values.

Another function will compare two piecewise exponential functions and detrmine 
if one is always greater than the other.
